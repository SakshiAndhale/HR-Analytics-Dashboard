# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains the HR Analytics Dashboard, designed to analyze and visualize employee attrition data within an organization. The dashboard is a powerful tool for HR professionals, data analysts, and organizational leaders to gain insights into factors contributing to employee turnover and to develop strategies to reduce attrition.

## Dashboard Features
- **Comprehensive Data Visualization**: The dashboard presents a wide range of metrics in an easy-to-understand format, including pie charts, bar graphs, and tables, allowing for a detailed analysis of employee attrition.
- **Interactivity**: Users can filter data based on different criteria, such as department and job role, to explore specific areas of interest.

## Key Metrics Targeted
The dashboard focuses on several key metrics that provide valuable insights into employee attrition:

- **Total Employee Count**: The overall number of employees within the organization (1470).
- **Attrition Numbers**: The total number of employees who have left the organization (237).
- **Attrition Rate**: The percentage of employees who have left, calculated as a proportion of the total workforce (16.1%).
- **Average Age**: The average age of the employees within the organization (37 years).
- **Average Salary**: The average salary of the employees, represented in thousands (6.5K).
- **Average Years with Company**: The average tenure of employees within the organization (7 years).
- **Distribution by Education, Job Role, Age, Salary Slab, and Years at Company**: Detailed breakdowns of how these factors correlate with attrition rates.

## Insights & Key Learnings
- **Attrition by Job Role**: Certain job roles, such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives, have higher attrition rates. This highlights the need for targeted interventions in these roles.
- **Education Level**: Employees with Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds make up a significant portion of those leaving the organization, indicating a potential mismatch in job expectations or satisfaction within these fields.
- **Salary Influence**: A majority of employees who left the organization were in the lower salary slab (up to 5K). This suggests that improving compensation packages could be an effective strategy for reducing attrition.
- **Age Distribution**: Younger employees, particularly those aged 26-35, exhibit higher attrition rates, which may reflect a desire for quicker career progression or dissatisfaction with current roles.
- **Years at Company**: There is a noticeable spike in attrition among employees who have been with the company for less than 2 years, indicating that the onboarding process and early career development opportunities might need improvement.

## Conclusions
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a clear understanding of the factors driving employee attrition within the organization. By analyzing these key metrics, the following strategic recommendations have been identified:

1. **Enhance Onboarding Processes**: To reduce early attrition, it's crucial to implement a more comprehensive onboarding program that helps new hires integrate into the company culture and understand their roles better.
2. **Offer Career Development Opportunities**: Providing employees with clear career paths and development opportunities can help retain top talent and reduce turnover.
3. **Improve Compensation Packages**: Ensuring that salaries are competitive and reflect the employees' contributions to the organization can address financial dissatisfaction and lower attrition rates.
4. **Promote Work-Life Balance**: Introducing flexible work arrangements and wellness programs can improve employee satisfaction and reduce burnout, which is a key factor in attrition.
